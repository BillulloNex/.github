## 🛠️ Journey

### 🐉 Year 1 
In 2024, we built websites & CRM, believing that would help businesses become more successful.

We made revenue & migrated IT infrastructure for many companies in Europe.

We learned how to work as a team.


### 🐍 Year 2
We realized AI solves a lot of problems we seek to fix for businesses.

We learned how to build products with substance.

### 🧃 The AI Box

On a trip to [Micro Center](https://www.microcenter.com/), we thought:

> What if AI can run locally in a box?

So we're working on the [AI Box](https://lab.billullonex.com/).
